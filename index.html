        <h2>Alalminórë</h2>
        <p class="verse">
            <span class="line">O ancient city on a leaguered hill!</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">Old shadows linger in your broken gate,</span><br />
            <span class="line">Your stones are grey, your old halls now are still,</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">Your towers silent in the mist await</span><br />
            <span class="line">Their crumbling end, while through the storeyed elms</span><br />
            <span class="line">The River Gliding leaves these inland realms</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">And slips between long meadows to the Sea,</span><br />
            <span class="line">Still bearing down by weir and murmuring fall</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">One day and then another to the Sea;</span><br />
            <span class="line">And slowly thither many days have gone</span><br />
            <span class="line">Since first the Edain built Kortirion.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
            <span class="line">Kortirion! Upon your island hill</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">With winding streets, and alleys shadow-walled</span><br />
            <span class="line">Where even now the peacocks pace in drill</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">Majestic, sapphirine and emerald,</span><br />
            <span class="line">Once long ago amid this sleeping land</span><br />
            <span class="line">Of silver rain, where still year-laden stand</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">In unforgetful earth the rooted trees</span><br />
            <span class="line">That cast long shadows in the bygone noon,</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">And whispered in the swiftly passing breeze,</span><br />
            <span class="line">Once long ago, Queen of the Land of Elms,</span><br />
            <span class="line">High City were you of the Inland Realms.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
            <span class="line">Your trees in summer you remember still:</span><br />
            <span class="line">The willow by the spring, the beech on hill;</span><br />
            <span class="line">The rainy poplars, and the frowning yews</span><br />
            <span class="line">Within your aged courts that muse</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">In sombre splendour all the day,</span><br />
            <span class="line">Until the firstling star comes glimmering,</span><br />
            <span class="line">And flittermice go by on silent wing;</span><br />
            <span class="line">Until the white moon slowly climbing sees</span><br />
            <span class="line">In shadow-fields the sleep-enchanted trees</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">Night-mantled all in silver-grey.</span><br />
            <span class="line">Alalminor! Here was your citadel,</span><br />
            <span class="line">Ere bannered summer from his fortress fell;</span><br />
            <span class="line">About you stood arrayed your host of elms:</span><br />
            <span class="line">Green was their armour, tall and green their helms,</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">High lords and captains of the trees.</span><br />
            <span class="line">But summer wanes. Behold, Kortirion!</span><br />
            <span class="line">The elms their full sail now have crowded on</span><br />
            <span class="line">Ready to the winds, like masts amid the vale</span><br />
            <span class="line">Of mighty ships too soon, too soon, to sail</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">To other days beyond these sunlit seas.</span>

            <span class="line">Alalminórë! Green heart of this Isle</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">Where linger yet the Faithful Companies!</span><br />
            <span class="line">Still undespairing here they slowly file</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">Down lonely paths with solemn harmonies:</span><br />
            <span class="line">The Fair, the first-born in an elder day,</span><br />
            <span class="line">Immortal Elves, who singing on their way</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">Of bliss of old and grief, though men forget,</span><br />
            <span class="line">Pass like a wind among the rustling trees,</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">A wave of bowing grass, and men forget</span><br />
            <span class="line">Their voices calling from a time we do not know,</span><br />
            <span class="line">Their gleaming hair like sunlight long ago.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
            <span class="line">A wind in the grass! The turning of the year.</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">A shiver in the reeds beside the stream,</span><br />
            <span class="line">A whisper in the trees - afar they hear,</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">Piercing the heart of summer&rsquo;s tangled dream,</span><br />
            <span class="line">Chill music that a herald piper plays</span><br />
            <span class="line">Foreseeing winter and the leafless days.</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">The late flowers trembling on the ruined walls</span><br />
            <span class="line">Already stoop to hear that elven-flute.</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">Through the wood&rsquo;s sunny aisles and tree-propped
                halls</span><br />
            <span class="line">Winding amid the green with clear cold note</span><br />
            <span class="line">Like a thin strand of silver glass remote.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
            <span class="line">The high-tide ebbs, the year will soon be spent;</span><br />
            <span class="line">And all your trees, Kortirion, lament.</span><br />
            <span class="line">At morn the whetstone rang upon the blade,</span><br />
            <span class="line">At eve the grass and golden flowers were laid</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">To wither, and the meadows bare.</span><br />
            <span class="line">Now dimmed already comes the tardier dawn,</span><br />
            <span class="line">Paler the sunlight fingers creep across the lawn.</span><br />
            <span class="line">The days are passing. Gone like moths the nights</span><br />
            <span class="line">When white wings fluttering danced like satellites</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">Round tapers in the windless air.</span><br />
            <span class="line">Lammas is gone. The Harvest-moon has waned.</span><br />
            <span class="line">Summer is dying that so briefly reigned.</span><br />
            <span class="line">Now the proud elms at last begin to quail,</span><br />
            <span class="line">Their leaves uncounted tremble and grow pale,</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">Seeing afar the icy spears</span><br />
            <span class="line">Of winter march to battle with the sun.</span><br />
            <span class="line">When bright All-Hallows fades, their day is done,</span><br />
            <span class="line">And borne on wings of amber wan they fly</span><br />
            <span class="line">In heedless winds beneath the sullen sky,</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">And fall like dying birds among the meres.</span>

            <span class="line">Alas! Kortirion, Queen of Elms, alas!</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">This season best befits your ancient town</span><br />
            <span class="line">With echoing voices sad that slowly pass,</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">Winding with waning music faintly down</span><br />
            <span class="line">The paths of standing mist. O fading time,</span><br />
            <span class="line">When morning rises late all hoar with rime,</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">And early shadows veil the distant woods!</span><br />
            <span class="line">Unseen the Elves go by, their shining hair</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">They cloak in twilight under secret hoods</span><br />
            <span class="line">Of grey, their dusk-blue mantles gird with bands</span><br />

            <span class="line">At night they dance beneath the roofless sky,</span><br />

            <span class="line">The Seven Stars, and through the boughs the eye</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">Stares down cold-gleaming in the high moon&rsquo;s face.</span><br />

            <span class="line">You sing now ancient songs that once awoke</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">Under primeval stars before the Dawn;</span><br />
            <span class="line">You dance like shimmering shadows in the wind,</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">As once you danced upon the shining lawn</span><br />
            <span class="line">Of Elvenhome, before we were, before</span><br />
            <span class="line">You crossed wide seas uno the mortal shore.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
            <span class="line">Now are your trees, old grey Kortirion,</span><br />
            <span class="line">Through pallid mists seen rising tall and wan,</span><br />
            <span class="line">Like vessels vague that slowly drift afar</span><br />
            <span class="line">Out, out to empty seas beyond the bar</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">Of cloudy ports forlorn;</span><br />
            <span class="line">Leaving behind for ever havens loud,</span><br />
            <span class="line">Wherein their crews a while held feasting proud</span><br />
            <span class="line">In lordly ease, they now like windy ghosts</span><br />
            <span class="line">Are wafted by cold airs to friendless coasts,</span><br />
            <span class="line line-indented">And silent down the tide are borne.</span><br />
            <span class="line">Bare has your realm become, Kortirion,</span><br />
            <span class="line">Stripped of its raiment, and its splendour gone.</span><br />
            <span class="line">Like lighted tapers in a darkened fane</span><br />
            <span class="line">The funeral candles of the Silver Wain</span><br />

            <span class="line">Here waiting they endure the winter fell</span><br />
